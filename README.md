# Weather-Website
Overview
This project involves creating a simple weather website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows users to enter a city name and retrieve the current weather information for that location. It provides a basic structure for making API calls to a weather service and displaying the results in a user-friendly format.

Project Structure
HTML (Structure)

The HTML file provides the basic structure of the web page. It includes elements like the input field for the city name, a button to trigger the weather search, and containers to display the weather information.
CSS (Styling)

The CSS file is used to style the web page, making it visually appealing. It includes styles for the body, container, input fields, and other elements to ensure the layout is clean and responsive.
JavaScript (Functionality)

The JavaScript file contains the logic to fetch weather data from a weather API based on the user's input. It updates the HTML with the retrieved weather information, making the app dynamic and interactive.
